# Bump version

This actions does 3 things:

-   Bumps the version number in the provided `version_file`.
-   Creates a tag for the new version (prefixed with the `prefix` input if provided).
-   Bumps all the versions under lines with the pattern `[bump]` (or `[bump if prefix]` if a prefix is provided).

**Please use the `js` branch as it is the one up to date.**

## Usage:

```yaml
- name: Bump version
  uses: remorses/bump-version@js
  with:
      version_file: ./VERSION
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Usage in a monorepo:

You can give a prefix to the tag, the action will relace version after line containing the pattern `[bump if {prefix}]`
Useful if you have many versions to bump.

```yaml
- name: Bump versions
  uses: remorses/bump-version@js
  with:
      version_file: ./dir2/VERSION
      prefix: dir2 # this will prefix the created tag
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
# will create the tag {prefix}_{version}
```

## ~~Using a prerelease tag~~

> This does not work with npm because you need to pass the `--tag` directly in the npm publish command

You can add a prerelease tag to a version using the `prerelease_tag` input

For example if you have `1.0.0` in `./VERSION`, the workflow below will commit the new version `1.0.1-alpha.0`

After the first prerelease `bump-version` will increase the tag version: `1.0.1-alpha.0` wil become `1.0.1-alpha.1`

```yaml
- name: Bump versions
  uses: remorses/bump-version@js
  with:
      version_file: ./VERSION
      prerelease_tag: alpha
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Created annotations

The action also creates annotations on the code and on the actions page
